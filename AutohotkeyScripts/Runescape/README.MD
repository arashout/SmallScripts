# Goblin Combat Automation
There is only one autohotkey script here and that is the script I wrote to fight goblins in runescape.
It uses autohotkeys image scanner to find goblins and start fighting them. Using the same technique it looks for dropped loot as well. 
#### It won't get you banned.
The best thing about the script is that since it looks for images, it introduces an aspect of randomness that is missing from many scripts.
This way you don't have to worry about being banned for unhumanlike behavior.
