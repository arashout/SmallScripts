<div class="text_to_html">
 <p>
  Securexam saves the response every minute and checks if the file contains data. If the Answer tab has been opened up and nothing has been typed into it for 15 minutes, Securexam will warn with a variation on the "no backups are being made" message:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Empty Document – Nothing Typed Warning! The system has detected that 15 saves and/or minutes have occurred without any text being typed. If there is text appearing on your screen in the document right now – STOP IMMEDIATELY and get a proctor before proceeding. If your document is blank and you have not typed any text yet and wish to continue, click on “Okay to continue”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <strong>
   This message will also appear if typing has only occurred in the Spreadsheet tab
  </strong>
  since Securexam is looking for content in the Answer tab.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <strong>
   To prevent this message from appearing, when you open an Answer tab, simply type the question number or just one character.
  </strong>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If there is text in the Answer tab, DO NOT shut down the computer. Ask the candidate to handwrite (or use a backup laptop, see
  <a href="http://moodle.casb.com/mod/wiki/view.php?pageid=173">

 <h3>
  Code of Conduct
 </h3>
</div>
<div class="text_to_html">
 <p>
  CPA expects IT Proctors to maintain a professional code of conduct that includes:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  •    Arrive on time and ready to work.
  <br/>
  •    Treat your colleagues and candidates with respect.
  <br/>
  •    Do not wear earbuds or listen to music or watch movies while on IT proctor duty.
  <br/>
  •    Minimize time outside of the exam room - you need to be in the room in case of computer issue.
  <br/>
  •    Have your cell phone powered on in case we need to contact you.
  <br/>
  •    Complete your tasks in a timely fashion and ask for help if you are running behind schedule.
  <br/>
  •    For lunch, bring something that is unlikely to cause offense - try to avoid items that are smelly or noisy.
  <br/>
  •    Don't wear perfume or cologne.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Feel free to wear casual clothes.  Jeans and a T-shirt are just fine.  Flip-flops can be noisy, so sneakers are a better choice.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some of these items may seem overly persnickety, but candidates are sensitive to distractions so we want to be mindful of them.

 <h3>
  Completing the Incident Report
 </h3>
</div>
<div class="text_to_html">
 <p>
  If you are required to take action on a candidate's laptop to address a technical issue, you must fill out an incident report to log the incident.
 </p>
 <p>
  You can find a link to the SurveyMonkey-based incident report on the front page of this site:
 </p>
 <p>
  <img alt="incident report link" class="img-responsive" height="74" src="http://moodle.casb.com/pluginfile.php/9655/mod_wiki/attachments/9/ir.jpg" style="vertical-align:text-bottom;margin:0 .5em;" width="344"/>
  <br/>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  It is very important that you provide as much detail as possible in your incident reports.  If a candidate decides to appeal their exam result based on their technical issues, we will be referring back to your notes to get a sense of the timeline and nature of the occurrence.

   http://cpa-canada.softwaresecure.com
  </a>
  website. The candidate must be registered as a CPA student to get access to the exam file.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If this is not the issue, connect the candidate’s laptop to the Internet, launch Securexam and click Get Exams and Licenses to update their license. If this fails to retrieve the Exams and Licenses, please try these steps:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  •    Exit Securexam and go to "My Documents"
  <br/>
  •    Rename the "My Exams" folder to "My Exams OLD"
  <br/>
  •    Click on the Start icon
  <br/>
  •    Choose Programs
  <br/>
  •    Choose Software Secure Inc
  <br/>
  •    Click Exams and Licenses
  <br/>
  •    Enter in the candidate’s email and password to retrieve new licenses and exams.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If a candidate is unable to download the exam licenses, the candidate must handwrite their responses or use a backup laptop (see:
  <a href="http://moodle.casb.com/mod/wiki/view.php?pageid=173">
   Using Backup Laptops
  </a>
  ). Please advise the PO if a candidate cannot continue on their laptop. Record the details in your online incident report (see:

  This issue may be fixed by connecting the laptop to the internet and launching Securexam - this allows the program to check for updates and then shut down access to the wireless adapter.  Once Securexam has updated (or just checked for updates) it's a good idea to exit Securexam and disable the wireless adapter.
 </p>
 <p>
  Note: students can prevent this error from occurring by checking for updates the day prior to the evaluation.

 <h3>
  Evaluation Sign-in Process
 </h3>
</div>
<div class="text_to_html">
 <p>
  Candidates will arrive up to an hour before the exam begins.  Normally, this means they'll start arriving at 8am.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Exam invigilation staff will sign them in and give them an exam package, which includes a USB key.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ask candidates to check to make sure that they are getting AC power to their laptop (i.e. it is not running on battery). Most laptop power supplies will have an indicator light which should be illuminated.  Ask candidates to wait and follow along with the Presiding Officer (PO) to sign into Securexam(CPA).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <strong>
   Note: laptops are mandatory for all evaluations.
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Candidates that arrive at the evaluation without a laptop should be referred to the PO.  They may not be permitted to write the exam.

  ExamRecovery tool
 </h3>
</div>
<div class="text_to_html">
 The ExamRecovery tool automates the collection of all Securexam files for a particular exam on a candidate's machine (including secondary backup files).
 <br/>
 <br/>
 ExamRecovery is included with the regular Securexam installation:

 <br/>
 <img alt="menu" class="img-responsive" height="157" src="http://moodle.casb.com/pluginfile.php/9655/mod_wiki/attachments/9/er.png" style="vertical-align:text-bottom;margin:0 .5em;" width="159"/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 When you run 'ExamRecovery' from the Software Secure Inc. menu, it brings up a dialogue to select the Candidate ID and Exam:
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <img alt="screenshot" class="img-responsive" height="540" src="http://moodle.casb.com/pluginfile.php/9655/mod_wiki/attachments/9/er1.png" style="vertical-align:text-bottom;margin:0 .5em;" width="899"/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 When you click the button, it compresses everything for that candidate/exam on the computer into a single zip file on the desktop. You can then just copy that file to a USB, Dropbox, or usually even just e-mail it. It contains the exam response, secondary backups, log files, and anything else generated by SE for that exam/candidate.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 If you are every dealing with a candidate that has had major issues during the exam, or there may be some concern regarding data loss, please ensure that you run this application at the end of the exam and provide the resulting zip to Shannon or Chelsea.

 <p>
  If the candidate has passed his/her Securexam(CPA) qualification exam, then chances are good that he/she will not experience difficulties during the exam. However, the Securexam(CPA) qualification exam is not a 100% indicator of a laptop's health, so problems can still occur.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <span style="text-decoration:underline;">
   File Handling
  </span>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Securexam(CPA), when operating properly, will save the candidate's files to the USB key every minute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If the candidate's computer suffers an unrecoverable hardware error, the files will be retrievable from the USB key.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If Securexam(CPA) is having issues with the USB key (i.e. cannot find it, or cannot write to it), Securexam(CPA) will deposit the encrypted file on the candidate's Desktop. The name of the file will look similar to this:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <i>
   CPA_Oct26Exam_4012345_20131026_1537.ssi-response
  </i>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If you cannot find the ssi-response file on the USB key, then it should be on the Desktop. If you cannot find it on the Desktop, check that the folder and search options view is set to show hidden files and folders. If you still cannot find them on the Desktop you will be able to find them archived.
  <br/>
 </p>
 <u>
  Secondary Back-up Files
 </u>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Securexam saves once a minute to the following folder:
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <i>
  C:\Users\(Your User Profile name)\AppData\Local\SSI\(your candidate ID)\(Exam name)
 </i>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Some of the folders in the destination above may be hidden.  To view, you must display hidden files and folders by editing folder options.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 There should be one subfolder for the Word portion and one subfolder for the Excel portion in the (Exam name) folder. Inside these folders are Securexam's automatic backup saves (saved once per minute). If you sort this folder by "Date Modified" you should see the most recently saved backup exam file for each subfolder, which should also correspond to the largest file size in the folder. If you see that the most recent file is *not* the largest file, it may be that the full exam was contained in one of the larger files saved a minute or two before the end of the exam.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 These secondary backups can be decrypted using Workbench to yield the candidate's response files.

If you cannot find it on the Desktop, check that the folder and search options view is set to show hidden files and folders. If you still cannot find them on the Desktop you will be able to find them archived. Check these locations in the following order. If you cannot find them in the “\email address\” folder, or if the date/timestamp isn’t correct, then use the files in the “\user name\” folder:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <strong>
   Windows XP:

  <br/>
  <br/>
  There is a hidden folder named “archive” under the email address folder. To view it, you must display hidden files and folders by editing folder options.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Files are also archived to this location (non OS specific):
  <br/>
  C: \ windows \ system32 \ SSI \ user name
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The name of the file to be recovered will be:
  <br/>
  Question name_user name_exam date_time.ssi-zarchive
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If an archive was not made (because of laptop failure, for example), secondary backups are stored in:

  <strong>
   Windows XP:
  </strong>
  <br/>
  [Drive:\] Documents and Settings\{User Profile Name}\Local Settings\Application Data\SSI\{UserName}\{ExamName_Date}

   Windows Vista or Windows 7/8:
  </strong>
  <br/>
  [Drive:\] Users\{User Profile Name}\AppData\Local\SSI\{UserName}\{ExamName_Date}
  <br/>

 <p>
  If a candidate experiences a problem during the exam process, there are a few points the IT Proctor should be aware of:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <strong>
   Time is of the essence!
  </strong>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During the exam, time is of the essence for the candidate. If there is a technical issue, the candidate should be instructed to start hand writing immediately while you try to solve the problem. Bring paper, a bubble sheet (for MCQ input), and a form for note-taking with you when you go to help a candidate. If a problem cannot be solved quickly (rule of thumb is usually within ten minutes), then the candidate will be required to write the remainder of their exam by hand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <strong>
   IT Proctors are not hardware technicians
  </strong>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Keeping the "time is of the essence" idiom in mind, IT Proctors are not expected to perform intensive diagnostics of a candidate's laptop if it fails. This is a job for the candidate's IT department.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <strong>
   Keep calm
  </strong>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The candidate needs to feel assured that you know what you are doing. Any uncertainty projected by you can undermine the candidate's confidence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <strong>
   Remember:
  </strong>
  The worst case scenario is that, after ten minutes, you will recover and print out the candidate's response and the candidate will write the balance of the exam by hand.  We have tracked candidates who wrote by hand and there is no correlation between writing by hand and failing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <strong>
   You are not alone!
  </strong>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If you experience something not covered in the following pages or are unsure how to proceed, contact Shannon Cuthbert (scuthbert@cpawsb.ca - for PEP exams) or Chelsea Hassan (chassan@cpawsb.ca - for PREP exams) -
  <strong>
   immediately.
  </strong>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <strong>
   You are not the Presiding Officer
  </strong>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apart from IT help, you are not to provide any other assistance to candidates. Candidates with any non-technical questions must be directed to an invigilator or the PO.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The PO will also be responsible for recording candidate numbers for candidates who turn up unexpectedly at centres. The PO will call
  <a href="http://moodle.casb.com/mod/wiki/view.php?pageid=219">
   Eric Olsen
  </a>
  at the Module Services Office if they need help with this: 1-866-420-2350.
 </p>
 <p>
  The PO is responsible for deciding about assigning extra time to candidates if they have technical difficulties. You may be asked for advice, but please understand that it is the PO who will make the final call.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Immediately advise the PO about any technical issues a candidate has.

  Online Checklists
 </h3>
</div>
<div class="text_to_html">
 <p>
  The process for online checklists for the CPA evaluations is a little different than the CASB evaluations
 </p>
 <p>
  This is the process to follow for CPA Evaluation online checklists:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  1.    For most evaluations you will be given access to your checklist a week prior to the evaluation date - when you are informed you have access, please check that this is indeed so. If you don't have access to an online checklist, contact Kathleen: kathleen.kort@casb.com
  <br/>
  <br/>
  2.    After candidates begin writing (about 9am) physically look at the sign in sheets the PO has and compare them to your own sheet. If there is a candidate on your checklist that is not on the PO's sheet or someone on the PO's sheet that is not on your checklist, immediately contact Kathleen and inform her of the discrepancy. Don't wait - this candidate may be writing in a different centre, so we need to track them.
 </p>
 <p>
  3. Mark absent students as absent as close to 9am as possible.
 </p>
 <p>
  4. If any student has to handwrite, make sure to note it in your checklist.
 </p>
 <p>
  5. The "upload Exam" column will indicate students that are present to write the CPA evaluation.
 </p>
 <p>
  <img alt="Online Checklist" height="243" src="http://moodle.casb.com/pluginfile.php/9655/mod_wiki/attachments/9/online_checklist.JPG" width="896"/>
 </p>
 <p>
  For CPA evaluations: as you will not be using Workbench to collect and decrypt the response files at the end of the evaluation and you will not be uploading the response files, that's it.  Make sure your checklist agrees with the PO's checklist as close to 9am as possible.  If there is a discrepancy, let Kathleen know ASAP.

  PointSec software fails to load
 </h3>
</div>
<div class="text_to_html">
 <p>
  This issue is sometimes experienced by candidates who are with firms that require encrypted keys (e.g. E&amp;Y). The PointSec software will fail to load, the key will remain unencrypted and the candidate will be unable to write to it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If there is another candidate nearby with the same firm (e.g. E&amp;Y), you can use that candidate's laptop to encrypt the key. Or:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  •    In the system tray (bottom right corner) click on PointSec
  <br/>
  •    Click on EPM Client
  <br/>
  •    Click on Import
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This should allow you to run the software and encrypt the key.

  Remote Desktop enabled
 </h3>
</div>
<div class="text_to_html">
 <p>
  Securexam will refuse to start if it detects that Remote Desktop is enabled on the computer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  1) To disable Remote Desktop:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <strong>
   Windows XP:
  </strong>
  <br/>
  •    Right-click the My Computer icon.
  <br/>
  •    Select the Properties command.
  <br/>
  •    Select the Remote tab.
  <br/>
  •    Remove the checkmarks under Remote Assistance and Remote Desktop. (Some computers may not display the “Remote Desktop” check box.)
  <br/>
  •    Click OK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <strong>
   Windows Vista, Windows 7/8:
  </strong>
  <br/>
  •    Right-click the Computer icon on the Start Menu.
  <br/>
  •    Select the Properties command.
  <br/>
  •    Click the Remote settings task.
  <br/>
  •    Click Continue if necessary.
  <br/>
  •    Remove the checkmark under Remote Assistance.
  <br/>
  •    If there is a “Remote Desktop” section, select the Don’t allow connections to this computer option.
  <br/>
  •    Click OK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  2) If Securexam continues to detect Remote Desktop, it will be necessary to disable the Remote Desktop services:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  •    Click the Start Menu.
  <br/>
  •    In
  <strong>
   Windows XP
  </strong>
  , select the Run command.
  <br/>
  •    In
  <strong>
   Windows Vista
  </strong>
  ,
  <strong>
   7/8
  </strong>
  , type the command into the Start search field.
  <br/>
  •    Type the command “Services.msc” and press the Enter key.
  <br/>
  •    Click Continue if necessary.
  <br/>
  •    Right-click the Remote Access Connection Manager entry.
  <br/>
  •    Select the Properties command.
  <br/>
  •    Change Startup type to Disabled.
  <br/>
  •    Click OK to close the Properties window.
  <br/>
  •    Right-click the Terminal Services entry.
  <br/>
  •    Select the Properties command.
  <br/>
  •    Change Startup type to Disabled.
  <br/>
  •    Click OK to close the Properties window.
  <br/>
  •    Restart the computer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At this point, if Securexam is still displaying messages about Remote Desktop, it is possible that the message is actually being caused by a problem with the laptop's power management system. The user should unplug the power cord to the laptop and try running Securexam again. Then plug the power cord back in.

 <p>
  <b>
   Steps:
  </b>
  <br/>
  1.    Open the workbench

 <p>
  2.    Click on the “Repair” tab on the top of the screen
 </p>
 <p>
  3.    Click on the “Grading ID Editor” button

  4.    Click on the “Select Files” button and browse to the location where you saved the encrypted file to be renamed
 </p>
 <p>
  5.    Select the file and click on “Open”

 <p>
  6.    In the grading ID column, double click on the ID you want to change, and type the new number

 <p>
  7.    Click on “Update Grading IDs” at the bottom of the screen
 </p>
 <p>
  8.    The ID will be updated.
 </p>
 <p>
  9.    Browse to the folder where you saved the original file. You will see the encrypted file renamed and a folder called @@ORIGINALEXMAS@@, where the original file is stored.

  Responding to IT Issues During an Evaluation
 </h3>
</div>
<div class="text_to_html">
 <p>
  Depending on the particular module, candidates will be writing evaluations with different types of questions.   There are case, MCQ and objective format question types.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If a technical problem arises during the evaluation, candidates will be required to immediately start handwriting on the CPA response paper provided. The IT proctor must immediately provide the response paper, and candidates should be told to assume that they are required to complete the remainder of their case evaluation by hand. If the issue cannot be resolved within 15 minutes, candidates must be informed by the IT proctor that they will be required to complete the remainder of their evaluation by hand.  The IT proctor will be responsible for recovering the encrypted ssi-response file from the USB drive, and printing out the candidate response (see
  <a href="http://moodle.casb.com/mod/wiki/view.php?pageid=58">
   Printing a Candidate’s Files
  </a>
  ).  The printed output may be given to the student, and will be combined with the handwritten candidate response for the remainder of the exam.

  <br/>
  The laptop must not be returned to the candidate until after the candidate has handed in their combined printed/handwritten response, and completed the sign-out process.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If the candidate's case response has any handwritten pages in it zip up that response file and email it to
  <a href="http://moodle.casb.com/mod/wiki/view.php?pageid=203">
   Kathleen Kort
  </a>
  . Put something like “collected response from candidate who finished the exam by handwriting” in the subject line or message of the email so it's handled correctly. Don't forget to include in your email the candidate's ID# and name. Also, it's a good idea to tell Kathleen that you've printed out the response and have given it to the PO who will send it to the appropriate people for processing.

  Securexam(CPA) Does Not Exit Properly – Proctor Password Window

  If an exam failed to exit properly, the Proctor Password window will appear when Securexam is launched.  If the laptop rebooted during an exam, Securexam will automatically launch and display the Proctor Password window when the laptop is restarted.

   One week (or more) prior:
  </span>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  •    Review the CPA IT Proctor Guide: spend 10-15 minutes re-familiarizing yourself with procedures.
  <br/>
  •    Ensure your Workbench is the correct version (version number will be posted on the CPA IT Proctor Communication website’s home page).  Run a test with the files posted on the Discussion forum to confirm it’s working properly.
  <br/>
  •    Ensure you have access to your online checklist.
  <br/>
  •    Ensure you know how to get to your evaluation location and what time you need to arrive.
  <br/>
  •    Ensure you have any internet login information required for your evaluation location.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <span style="text-decoration:underline;">
   The Evening prior:
  </span>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  •    Don’t forget to plug in your cell phone so you have a full charge for evaluation day.
  <br/>
  •    Login to the CPA IT Proctor Communication website to check the discussion board for:
  <br/>
  •    Securexam passwords, exam files, exam bar colours
  <br/>
  •    Last minute instructions
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <span style="text-decoration:underline;">
   Morning of the Evaluation:
  </span>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  •    Check the Discussions forum for any last minute instruction
  <br/>
  •    Cell phone and charger?
  <br/>
  •    Laptop loaded with Workbench?

  <span style="text-decoration:underline;">
   On Evaluation Day
  </span>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Evaluations will start at 9 AM local and will run for 3 or 4 hours. IT Proctors are expected to arrive in the appropriate room at the evaluation centre at 8 AM.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Get to the exam centre on time!  That means being in the room and ready to work at 8 AM.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Setup your printer and print a test page from Workbench to ensure it's ready in case you need it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Check the Discussions forum for last minute instructions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For CFE, CPA provides backup laptops - set one up so it's ready in case you need it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Turn your cell phone to vibrate rather than ring.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Copy exam files (posted on the Discussions forum) onto a USB key.  Keep that key plus a couple of blank keys with you in case you need them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  About 20 minutes before the start of the exam, the PO will read out the Laptop Instructions for Students (found on the Discussions forum). The instructions must be read out – if the PO is not doing this please intervene. While the PO is reading out the instructions circulate around the room.  It is preferable to get candidates to the point after the entry password is given and before they enter “start” at least 10 minutes before the scheduled start of the exam so you have some time to deal with any problems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the scheduled exam start time, the PO will ask candidates to enter “start”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Candidates should check that the colour of the exam title bar is correct (the day before the exam, this colour will be posted on the CPA IT Proctor Communication website along with the entry, exit, and proctor password).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Candidates must be asked to check that they have the correct number and type of questions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Once candidates are writing, follow the instructions found in the
  <a href="http://moodle.casb.com/mod/wiki/view.php?pageid=129">
   Online Checklists
  </a>
  section.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During the exam you may be needed to help candidates deal with occasional laptop issues. Please follow the processes outlined in
  <a href="http://moodle.casb.com/mod/wiki/view.php?pageid=42">
   IT Issue during the MCQ Portion
  </a>
  ,

  .
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Don't forget to document any incidents to the Incident Report form.  If you are in doubt of whether or not to enter something in please err on the side of entering in something not needed rather than not entering something.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There is no break between Objective Format and Case questions, so candidates can decide how to spend the time (though CPA will provide recommendations):
  <br/>
  <br/>
 </p>
 <p>
  At the end of the exam, BEFORE giving candidates the exit password, the PO must ask them to check that all of their spreadsheet responses are contained within columns A–N (see Laptop Instructions for Students posted on the Discussions forum).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <span style="text-decoration:underline;">
   After Candidates have Finished Writing
  </span>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Candidates will hand in their USB keys to the invigilators (by Module and student number in larger centres).  Once the PO has confirmed that all USB keys have been accounted for s/he will pass them on to you.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  •    Count the number of keys you have received and confirm it is the correct number (the same number as on your checklist).
  <br/>
  •    Give your keys to the head IT Proctor who will hold onto the USB keys until s/he is instructed to send them back using the prepaid envelope.

  Using Backup Laptops
 </h3>
</div>
<div class="text_to_html">
 <p>
  Backup laptops are provided by CPA for CFE only. Candidates can supply their own backup laptop at any exam, provided that the correct version of Securexam(CPA) is installed and tested on it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <span style="text-decoration:underline;">
   For the laptops that CPA supplies during CFE
  </span>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  •    Set up a supplied backup laptop on the morning of each evaluation day
  <br/>
  •    Boot up the laptop and get it ready in case it’s needed. There should be instructions on each of the provided backup laptops regarding log in – to the laptop and to Securexam.
  <br/>
  •    Normally the Securexam username will be kort@casb.com or kathleen.kort@casb.com password: backup.  You can tell what the username is by by going to Documents-&gt;My Exams and seeing the folder name in the "My Exams" folder.
  <br/>
  •    The candidate will use his/her CPA candidate number for exam identification (see Discussion board posting PDF "Laptop instructions for students" in the "Enter your exam identification" section).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <span style="text-decoration:underline;">
   If a candidate's laptop fails at the beginning of an exam:
  </span>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  •    Provide the backup laptop and handle the response as usual.
  <br/>
  •    Note the entity number of the backup laptop, and the name and candidate number of the candidate.
  <br/>
  •    Enter the information into the incident report site.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <span style="text-decoration:underline;">
   If a candidate's laptop fails during an exam:
  </span>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  •    Provide the backup laptop with a new USB key.
  <br/>
  •    Print the candidate's response collected from the original USB key.
  <br/>
  •    Give the candidate the printed response as soon as possible.
  <br/>
  •    At the end of the exam, email in both .ssi-response files to Kathleen with the explanation "Candidate wrote on two laptops so has two response files"
  <br/>
  •    Note the entity number of the backup laptop, and the name and candidate number of the candidate. Enter the information into the incident report site.

        The "Laptop Instructions for Students" PDF posted on the Discussions board will walk candidates through Securexam start up and exit step-by-step.  The Presiding Officer (PO) will read out these instructions to candidates while you circulate in the room to address possible issues.  Please ensure candidates are waiting to follow along with the PO's instructions rather than getting ahead of them.  They may think that they know what they're doing, but evaluations require slightly different procedures than practice, so ask them to wait and follow along.

     Securexam is “lockdown” software that allows candidates to use their laptops in an environment that prohibits access to certain functions, files, and the Internet to ensure all candidates are working from a level playing field.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     In order for candidates to use their laptops for any CPA evaluation, they must have previously installed Securexam(CPA), run a qualification exam, and had their laptop approved by Securexam. This process assists in finding and solving any laptop glitches prior to an exam.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Securexam does not support Macintosh computers – even if "Boot Camp" is installed. Candidates are not allowed to use Macs to write the exams.  Securexam also does not support tablets - this includes Surface machines if the keyboard is detachable.

  What is the latest version of Securexam?

  Securexam 8.2.4 is the current version.

  SE 8.2.4 is compatible with Workbench 3.4.0.

 (SC - 9/19/2016)
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <b>
  <b>
   -----------------
  </b>
  <br/>
  Updates for previous version 8.2.3
  <br/>
  <br/>
 </b>
 Patch notes are as follows:
 <br/>
 <br/>
 SSIRunTimeServices Check added - The SSIRunTimeServices Check will run when the software launches, and if the service is disabled the user will see the following message:
 <br/>
 <br/>

 <br/>
 We believe that this will be a helpful addition for the candidates.
 <b>
  <br/>
 </b>
 <br/>
 The version of Workbench released with SE 8.2.3 is Workbench 3.4.0.
 <b>
  <br/>
  <br/>
 </b>
 (Note: Exams written in either Securexam Version 8.2.1 or 8.2.3. can be decrypted by either Workbench Version 3.3.0 or Version 3.4.0.)
 <b>
  <br/>
  -----------------
  <br/>
  Updates for 8.2.2
 </b>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Patch notes are as follows:
 <br/>
 <br/>
 1.    Removed Clipboard Watcher routines – suspicion that these routines may have corrupted memory when doing cut/paste operations.
 <br/>
 2.    During finalization phase – test internal Exam In Progress variable for illegal path characters – if detected, skip code that copies the Server log files over for the final response creation.  If the path has illegal characters, this will cause the software to crash with a finalization error and NOT create the final response file.
 <br/>
 3.    Added additional finalization logging to the ssi_err.log file.
 <br/>
 4.    Updated the Exam Recovery program to look for and copy the ssi_err.log if found (unfortunately copying dump files require admin privileges).
 <br/>
 5.    Updated the Exam Recovery program to look for and copy the SSI_Support.txt log file if found on user’s desktop.
 <br/>
 6.    Wrapped a few routines with code to provide a stacktrace to the logs on any exception.
 <br/>
 7.    Software will *always* check for updates if connected to Internet (not required to go to Exam and Licenses) so as to mitigate future correspondence issues.
 <br/>
 8.    Updated SES version number to v8.2.2
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The version of Workbench that is compatible with SE 8.2.2 is Workbench 3.3.0.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 -----------------
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <b>
  Updates for 8.2.0
 </b>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <ol>
  <li>
   The MCQ Component has been updated – in some rare instances, the MCQs were not saving on a user’s system.   From a user’s perspective, all that has changed is that they now have to click on a “Start” button when they first open up the MCQ section.
  </li>
  <li>
   On the Spreadsheet component, the “Show Printable Area” option has been removed.
  </li>
  <li>
   The “Practice/Generic” button has been removed – Practice exams are now available through the regular exam list and now more closely resemble an actual exam in terms of procedures.
  </li>
  <li>
   Added a “Securexam Version Checker” icon to the desktop – this utility will now show the user exactly which version they are using.
  </li>
  <li>
   Improved support for non- “My Documents” exam locations.
  </li>
  <li>
   There were also additional minor fixes to the secondary naming conventions,  finalizing exam procedures and updating backup routines that we expect to prevent issues in the future.
  </li>
 </ol>

 The version of Workbench that is compatible with SE 8.2.0 is Workbench 3.3.0.
